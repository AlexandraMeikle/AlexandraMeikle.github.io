This is my second year within the sleep lab. The group collaborates on research, and meets fortnightly to discuss current topics and published papers in sleep research, and preliminary data and projects. Topics discussed include: animal physiology and circadian timing, human sleep and its disorders, and mental health and treatment implications.
