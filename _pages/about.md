I am a postgraduate student in the University of Glasgow's
[Institute of Neuroscience and Psychology](http://www.gla.ac.uk/researchinstitutes/neurosciencepsychology/). I graduated from the University of Glasgow in 2018 with an M.A. in Psychology (with Honours of the First Class), and I'm now working towards an M.Sc.in Research Methods in Psychological Science supervised by [Prof Stephany Biello](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/stephanybiello/) and [Dr Maria Gardani](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/psychology/staff/mariagardani/).

**Research Interests**

I am currently interested in issues regarding student mental health. Specifically, on-campus mental health services which aim to provide early intervention with the goal of improving access to counselling services.

Ongoing Research Projects
------

**Evaluating User and Supporter Experiences of a Student-Led Peer Support Service** <br>
The aim of this project is to evaluate the University of Glasgow's [CaPS Peer Support service](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/counselling/peersupport/). The student-led service provides information and support for students with mild mental health issues. I will be involved in the initial stages of a mixed-method investigation to collect the experiences of those involved with the service, and use this to facilitate and inform the upcoming expansion of the program.


**Systematic Review: Mental Health of Postgraduate Students** <br>

I will also be assisting [Jelena Milicev](http://www.psy.gla.ac.uk/staff/?id=JM010) in writing a systematic review on the prevalence of mental health issues in postrgraduate students.
